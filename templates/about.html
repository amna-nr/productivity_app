<h4>Functionality</h4>

<!-- Text generated by chatgpt -->
<p>
    This application is designed to help users manage tasks in a simple, focused way.
    Tasks can be added to the <strong>To Do</strong> column and moved to <strong>Doing</strong> by clicking on them.
    To reduce cognitive overload, users are encouraged to keep only one task in the Doing column at a time.
</p>

<p>
    Once a task is completed, it can be moved to <strong>Done</strong> by clicking on it.
    Points are awarded only when tasks are actually completed to ensure that the productivity data
    shown in the report remains accurate.
</p>

<p>
    Each completed task awards <strong>100 points</strong>.
    Reaching <strong>500 points</strong> unlocks mood-based task recommendations, and
    <strong>1000 points</strong> unlocks a personalized productivity report.
</p>

<p>
    The point-based system is inspired by the brain’s dopamine reward mechanism.
    By gradually unlocking features instead of providing instant rewards,
    the app encourages consistency, motivation, and long-term productivity.
    Users are encouraged to treat productivity as a game rather than a chore.
</p>

<h4>Mood-Based Recommendations & Productivity Report</h4>

<p>
    Mood-based task recommendations are unlocked after reaching 500 points.
    This feature encourages users to reflect on their current emotional state
    and receive task suggestions that better align with their mood, helping reduce
    burnout and resistance to starting tasks.
</p>

<p>
    After reaching 1000 points, users unlock a productivity report that provides
    an overview of completed tasks and overall progress.
    This report is designed to promote self-awareness rather than pressure,
    allowing users to identify patterns in their productivity and make
    more informed decisions moving forward.
</p>

<h4>Design Choices</h4>

<p>
    The application intentionally prioritizes simplicity over complexity.
    Features are unlocked progressively to avoid overwhelming users and to promote
    sustainable productivity habits rather than short bursts of motivation.
