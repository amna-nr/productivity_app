CS50 Final Project: Task Management Web App

A minimalist task management web app that uses a point-based system to gamify productivity and unlock additional features.

Users can register and log in to manage their tasks and track progress through a points system. Tasks are added to a To Do column and can be moved to Doing and Done by clicking on them. Each completed task awards
100 points, encouraging consistency through small, achievable wins.
As users accumulate points, additional features are unlocked. At 500 points, users gain access to a mood-based task recommendation feature, which suggests tasks based on how the user is feeling. At 1000 points,
users unlock a productivity report that displays completed tasks, total tasks added, and an overall productivity score.
The application is intentionally designed to be minimalist in order to avoid overwhelm and reduce procrastination. By focusing on simple task progression, visual feedback, and gradual rewards, the app helps users
build momentum and maintain consistent productivity over time.

Features:
- User authentication system with registration and login
- To-do, Doing and Done states for tasks
- Point based reward system
- Productivity report
- Mood selection for tasks
- Motivational quotes
